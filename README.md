# Logstop

:fire: Keep personally identifiable information (PII) out of your logs

```ruby
logger.info "Hi test@example.org!"
# => Hi [FILTERED]!
```

By default, scrubs:

- email addresses
- phone numbers
- credit card numbers
- Social Security numbers (SSNs)
- passwords in urls

Works with all types of logging - Ruby, ActiveRecord, ActiveJob, and more

```
User Load (0.1ms)  SELECT "users".* FROM "users" WHERE "users"."email" = ?  [["email", "[FILTERED]"]]
```

## Installation

Add this line to your applicationâ€™s Gemfile:

```ruby
gem 'logstop'
```

And add it to your logger:

```ruby
Logstop.guard(logger)
```

### Rails

Create `config/initializers/logstop.rb` with:

```ruby
Logstop.guard(Rails.logger)
```

## Options

To scrub IP addresses, use:

```ruby
Logstop.guard(logger, ip: true)
```

Add custom rules with: [master]

```ruby
scrubber = lambda do |msg|
  msg.gsub(/custom_regexp/, "[FILTERED]".freeze)
end

Logstop.guard(logger, scrubber: scrubber)
```

To scrub outside of logging, use:

```ruby
Logstop.scrub(msg)
```

It supports the same options as `guard`.

## Notes

This should be used in addition to `config.filtered_parameters`, not as a replacement.
